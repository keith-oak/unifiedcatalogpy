# Introducing: UnifiedCatalogPy

A Python wrapper for Microsoft Purview Data Governance's Unified Catalog API.

## Overview ðŸ”¥

UnifiedCatalogPy simplifies the interaction with Microsoft Purview's Unified Catalog API. It provides a set of features that allow you to manage and interact with various data governance elements, including:

- Governance Domains (Discovery and Management)
  - Glossary Terms
  - Data Products
  - OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
  - Critical Data Elements
- Health Management
  - Health Controls
  - Health Actions
  - ~~Data Quality~~ (no API support yet!)

> [!WARNING]
> This library is currently in development and the features listed above are yet to be implemented.

## Quick Start ðŸš€

Start by installing the library. You will also need to install the `azure-identity` library to authenticate with Microsoft Purview.

```bash
# Installation
pip install unifiedcatalogpy azure-identity
```

In your Python code, you can use the library as follows:

```python
# Import the dependencies
from unifiedcatalogpy import UnifiedCatalogClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# ...Coming soon...
```
