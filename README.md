# Introducing: UnifiedCatalogPy

An unofficial Python wrapper for Microsoft Purview Data Governance's Unified Catalog API. Not affiliated or officially supported by Microsoft. Built as a personal project by observing Microsoft Purview browser network calls and reverse engineering the API.

## Overview üî•

UnifiedCatalogPy simplifies the interaction with Microsoft Purview's Unified Catalog API. It provides a set of features that allow you to manage and interact with various data governance elements, including operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting business concepts.

**Interact with:**

- Governance Domains (Discovery and Management)
  - Glossary Terms
  - Data Products
  - OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
  - Critical Data Elements
- Health Management
  - Health Controls
  - Health Actions
  - ~~Data Quality~~ (no API support yet!)

> [!WARNING]
> This library is currently in development and the features listed above are yet to be implemented. It is not affiliated with Microsoft.

## Quick Start üöÄ

Start by installing the library. You will also need to install the `azure-identity` library to authenticate with Microsoft Purview.

```bash
# Install the library
pip install unifiedcatalogpy azure-identity
```

In your Python code, you can use the library as follows:

```python
# Import the library
from unifiedcatalogpy import UnifiedCatalogClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Unified Catalog Client
client = UnifiedCatalogClient(
    account_id="<your-purview-account-id>",
    credential=credential
)

# Interact with the client
domains = client.get_governance_domains()
```

Detailed usage examples for each feature are provided in the sections below.

## Documentation üìñ

These features are yet to be developed, but the following are planned:

#### Governance Domain

An organizational object that provides context for your data assets and make it easier scale data governance practices. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-governance-domain)

##### Create a Governance Domain

```python
# Create a new governance domain
new_domain = client.create_governance_domain(
    name="My First Domain",
    description="<div>This is an example of a <b>rich text</b> description.</div>",
    type="FunctionalUnit",
    owners=[{ "id": "<owner-principal-id>" }],
    status="Draft",
)

# Show the new governance domain
print(new_domain)
```

##### Retrieve Governance Domains

```python
# Get all governance domains
domains = client.get_governance_domains()
```

##### Update a Governance Domain

##### Delete a Governance Domain

```python
# Delete a governance domain by ID
deleted = client.delete_governance_domain("<your-governance-domain-id>")
if deleted:
    print("Governance domain deleted successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to delete governance domain.")
```

#### Glossary Term

Active values that provide context but also apply policies that determine how your data should be managed, governed, and made discoverable for use. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-glossary-terms)

##### Create a Glossary Term

```python
# Create new Glossary Term
term = client.create_term(
    name="My First Term",
    description="<div>This is a <b>rich description</b> of my first term.</div>",
    status="Draft",
    governance_domain_id="<your-governance-domain-id>",
    acronyms=["ACRONYM_1", "ACRONYM_2"],
    resources=[
        {
            "name": "Read more details",
            "url": "https://example.com",
        }
    ],
    owners=[{"id": "<owner-principal-id>"}],
)

# Show the new glossary term
print(term)
```

##### Retrieve Glossary Terms

```python
# Get all terms in the Governance Domain
terms = client.get_terms("<your-governance-domain-id>")

for term in terms:
    print(term)
```

##### Retrieve a Glossary Term by ID

```python
# Get a specific term by ID
term = client.get_term_by_id("<your-term-id>")

# Show the term
print(term)
```

##### Update a Glossary Term

##### Delete a Glossary Term

```python
# Delete a term
deleted = client.delete_term("<your-term-id>")

if deleted:
    print("Governance domain deleted successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to delete governance domain.")
```

#### Data Product

A kit of data assets (tables, files, Power BI reports, etc.) that provides assets with a use case for ease of discovery and understanding. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-data-products)

#### OKRs

Objectives and key results link data products directly to your objectives to bridge the gap between your business and Unified Catalog. You use data to discover and track objectives in your business, and Unified Catalog should make it easy to see those connections and track your goals. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-okr)

##### Create an OKR

### Health Management

Health management refers to the ongoing processes and practices involved in ensuring that an organization's data remains accurate, complete, consistent, secure, and accessible throughout its lifecycle.

#### Health Controls

Track your journey to complete data governance by monitoring health controls to track your progress. Health controls measure your current governance practices against standards that give your data estate a score. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-health-controls)

##### Create a Health Control

##### Retrieve a Health Control

## Setup Instructions üõ†

1. Ô∏èNavigate to the Azure portal to [create a new Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/tutorial-using-rest-apis) for your application.
2. Copy the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and Client Secret (value) into your Python environment variables.

```

AZURE_CLIENT_ID=
AZURE_TENANT_ID=
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=

```

3. Navigate to Properties tab of your Microsoft Purview Azure resource to locate your Purview account ID. It can be found in the Atlas endpoint URL.

```

https://<your-purview-account-id>-api.purview-service.microsoft.com/catalog

```

Copy the `<your-purview-account-id>` value into your Python environment variables.

```

```

4. Navigate to the Microsoft Purview portal _> Settings > Solution Settings > Unified Catalog > Roles and Permissions > Data Governance Administrators_ to add the Service Principal as a Data Governance Administrator.
